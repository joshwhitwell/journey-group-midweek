    <h1>Midweek 2024</h1>

    <h2>Format</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each person is assigned to a group consisting of 2-3 cross-studio
        collaborators
      </li>
      <li>
        Each group is assigned a date on which they will lead BOTH Midweek AND
        Doodling (including Doodling Vibes®, i.e., music selection)
      </li>
      <li>
        The format of the activity for that week (e.g., presentation, workshop,
        field trip, etc.) is up to the group, but should be thematically related
        to one of the prompts below
      </li>
      <li>
        Official programming will begin at 12:15pm each week; the exact
        breakdown between Midweek and Doodling is flexible, but sufficient time
        should be reserved for the latter (~20 minutes)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prompts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Inspire:</strong> Showcase a design, person, or idea that you
        find inspiring. A given group does not have to agree on a single source
        of inspiration; it could synthesize topics across categories, or
        alternatively compare and contrast within a category.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Educate:</strong> Teach us about a current trend(s) that you see
        emerging in your professional work or in society. Help us to
        contextualize and to think better about this trend across modalities
        (for instance as designers, as a community, as individuals).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Challenge:</strong> Pose a design problem(s) that we workshop
        collectively or in small groups. The problem could be a
        concrete/technical challenge (e.g., redesign a local business’s brand,
        or reimagine the 418 parking lot mural), or more abstract (e.g., how can
        we incorporate more natural space into our urban environment?).
      </li>
    </ul>
